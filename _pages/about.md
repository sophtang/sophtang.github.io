Hi! I am a third-year undergraduate student at the University of Pennsylvania conducting research in generative ML for scientific discovery. Aside from research, I study computer science and statistics in the [Jerome Fisher Program in Management & Technology](https://fisher.wharton.upenn.edu/).

Currently, I’m part of the [Chatterjee Lab](https://www.chatterjeelab.com/), developing theoretical ML frameworks for biological design, and the [Mitchell Lab](https://mitchell-lab.seas.upenn.edu/), designing lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-based delivery vehicles to transport mRNA across the blood-brain barrier. 

My research ranges from developing theoretical [Schrödinger bridge frameworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07406) for generative modelling of [branching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09007) and [interacting particle systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07406) to [multi-objective RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25171) and [guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17780) techniques for discrete diffusion - but I’m always exploring new theoretical ideas and thinking about interesting problems to apply them to! 

I also write technical articles on my Substack, [Alchemy Bio](https://alchemybio.substack.com/). My most read article, [“A Complete Guide to Spherical Equivariant Graph Transformers”](https://alchemybio.substack.com/p/spherical-equivariant-graph-transformer) is a 2.5-hour long read breaking down the mathematics and physics underlying the structural deep learning architectures for molecules and proteins.

If you’re also passionate about any of these topics, I would love to connect via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophia-tang-05/) or [X](https://x.com/_sophia_tang_).
