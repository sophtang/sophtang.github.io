Hi! I'm a third-year undergraduate student at the University of Pennsylvania conducting research at the intersection of ML and biological discovery! Aside from research, I'm also a dual degree student studying computer science and business in the [Jerome Fisher Program in Management & Technology](https://fisher.wharton.upenn.edu/).

I'm part of the [Chatterjee Lab](https://www.chatterjeelab.com/), developing theoretical ML frameworks for biological design, and the [Mitchell Lab](https://mitchell-lab.seas.upenn.edu/), designing lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-based delivery vehicles to transport mRNA across the blood-brain barrier. Working across two labs has taught me so much about both the computational and wet-lab sides of bioengineering research, which you can explore on my [publications](/publications/) page.

One of my favourite aspects of research is gaining a deep understanding of the theory behind the mechanisms governing the algorithms or biological processes that I study. To share this interest, I began writing in-depth technical guides on my Substack, [Alchemy Bio](https://alchemybio.substack.com/). My most read article, [“A Complete Guide to Spherical Equivariant Graph Transformers”](https://alchemybio.substack.com/p/spherical-equivariant-graph-transformer) is a 2.5-hour long read breaking down the mathematics and physics underlying the structural deep learning architectures for molecules and proteins.

If you’re also passionate about any of these topics, I would love to connect via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophia-tang-05/) or [X](https://x.com/_sophia_tang_).
