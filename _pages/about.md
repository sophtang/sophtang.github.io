Hi! I am a second-year undergraduate student at the University of Pennsylvania pursuing a dual degree in computer science and business in the [Jerome Fisher Program in Management & Technology](https://fisher.wharton.upenn.edu/).

I conduct research at the [Chatterjee Lab](https://www.chatterjeelab.com/) at [Duke University](https://pratt.duke.edu/) developing generative deep learning models for biological discovery and at the [Mitchell Lab](https://mitchell-lab.seas.upenn.edu/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://be.seas.upenn.edu/) designing lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-based delivery vehicles to transport mRNA across the blood-brain barrier. Working across two labs has enabled me to gain experience in both the computational and wet-lab side of bioengineering innovation, which you can see on my [publications](/publications/) page.

One of my favourite aspects of research is deeply understanding the theory behind the mechanisms governing the algorithms or biological processes that I study. To share this interest, I began writing in-depth technical guides on my substack, [Alchemy Bio](https://alchemybio.substack.com/). My most read article, [“A Complete Guide to Spherical Equivariant Graph Transformers”](https://alchemybio.substack.com/p/spherical-equivariant-graph-transformer) is a 2.5-hour long read breaking down the mathematics and physics underlying the structural deep learning architectures for molecules and proteins.

If you’re also passionate about any of these topics, I would love to connect via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophia-tang-05/).
