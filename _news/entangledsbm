[EntangledSBM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07406) is out! Read our paper on simulating interacting multi-particle systems with novel Schrödinger bridge matching framework! We will present EntangledSBM at NeurIPS 2025 in the [FPI](https://fpineurips.framer.website/) and [SPIGM](https://spigmworkshopv3.github.io/) workshops, so come say hi!
